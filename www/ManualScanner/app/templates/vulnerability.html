                <h2><center>Vulnerability Report Guidelines</center></h2>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>Considering what bugbounty.site is designed for, we take security of the system seriously. That said, if you find a security vulnerability on this application, we would love to know about it. To reach out to us with vulnerability details, please email us at bugbountysite@gmail.com and we will try to reach out to you as soon as possible.</p>
                <h3>Credits and Monetary Rewards</h3>
                <p>Currently this project is free for use so we will not be able to reward you with a monetary reward. However, we are more than happy to credit you for your finding through the <a href="{{ url_for('home.give_credits') }}">thank you</a> page. <i>This might however change in future.</i></p>
                <h3>Ground Rules</h3>
                <p>Treat each vulnerability as "See Something, Say Something". If you find a security issue, let us know instantly and do not try to exploit it further. For example, if you find a RCE on this application, just pull /etc/passwd and send us the report with it. We will validate the report on our end and make sure it is handled. Escalation of a vulnerabiility or exploitation will lead to permanaent ban from the application.<p>
                <p>Additionally, if you report something and it was previously reported by another researcher, we will provide you the timestamp and the subject of the email. That way, a mutual trust relationship stands between bugbounty.site and the researcher community.</p>
                <h3>What is not a valid vulnerability:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. We are aware that this page does not have SSL at the moment. We will be adding that soon.</li>
                    <li>2. SPF issues. We currently use mailgun and we expect that individuals who use bugbounty.site are knowledgeable to distinguish between a fake email vs an original email sent through the platform.</li>
                    <li>3. Content Injection / Text Spoofing: Unless there is an XSS or HTML injection, we will not accept reports regarding Text Spoofing.</li>
                </ul>
		<h3>What we are interested in:</h3>
		<ul>
		    <li>1. Currently, to prevent malicious use of this application through s3 takeovers, we use a uuid session system. If you can takeover a domain through http://scan.bugbounty.site/takeover/domain/ without the use of UUID, we would love to know about it.</li>
		    <li>2. Reflected XSS</li>
		    <li>3. Any vulnerabilities on open ports in this server is fair game. This is because, we have more applications that we are building that are in this server. If you find a vulnerability on them we would love to know.</li>
		    <li>4. CSRF attack: even though we do not have user profiles setup or have any sort of sensitive forms, we still want to know of any CSRF attack you find in the application.</li>
		    <li>5. Remote Code Execution</li>
		    <li>6. Subdomain Takeovers: Even though we are careful to protect takeovers by not having any domains that point to unused third party service, we will like to know about any cases where that behavior is not common. Please make sure to actually takeover the domain before you report it to us because sometimes there might be false positives.</li> 
		    <li>7. If you land on a form page that requires <b>Beta users key</b>, but you are still able to use the tool then we want to know about it. Tools with beta users requirement are up for vetted users only. Most of these tools will also have a "App is currently under construction" banner on them.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Domain in Scopes:</h3>
		<ul>
		    <li>*.bugbounty.site</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We use security.network and securifyredteam.com as test targets. Both of these domains will have different vulnerabilties and we are aware of those. Please do not report issues on them.</p>
